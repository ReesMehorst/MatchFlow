# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
As the sole maintainer of this project, I am committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone who interacts with this project, including users, contributors, and collaborators.

Participation in this project is expected to be respectful and professional, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
* Demonstrating empathy and respect toward others
* Being considerate of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving constructive feedback in a respectful manner
* Accepting responsibility for mistakes and learning from them
* Keeping discussions focused on the project and its goals

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
* Sexualized language, imagery, or unwanted sexual attention
* Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, including personal or political attacks
* Harassment, intimidation, or threats, whether public or private
* Publishing private information (such as email addresses or personal details) without explicit permission
* Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or open-source setting

## Maintainer Responsibilities
This project is maintained by a single individual. The maintainer is responsible for:
* Interpreting and enforcing this Code of Conduct
* Taking appropriate and proportionate action in response to unacceptable behavior
* Moderating or removing contributions, comments, or interactions that violate this Code of Conduct

All enforcement decisions are made at the sole discretion of the maintainer.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including but not limited to:
* Source code repositories
* Issue trackers and pull requests
* Discussions, comments, and reviews
* Any public communication directly related to this project

It also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces (for example, through official project communication channels).

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported directly to the project maintainer at:

`LinkedIn` or `Github profile`

Reports will be reviewed in good faith. While complete confidentiality cannot be guaranteed in a solo-maintained project, reasonable efforts will be made to respect the privacy of the reporter.

## Enforcement Guidelines

The following guidelines are used to determine appropriate consequences. Not all situations fit neatly into these categories; the maintainer may escalate or de-escalate actions as appropriate.

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.
